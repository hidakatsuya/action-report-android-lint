If you want to include resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a test source set instead.&#xA;&#xA;You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude them (usually for performance reasons), use lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.&#xA;,">
